/***
 * This class implements a single pass threshold clustering algorithm.
 * 
 * The algorithm is defined as:
 *    set clusters = []
 *    for each instance
 *    	 best cluster = none
 *    	 best score = infinity
 *       for each cluster in clusters
 *          if distance(instance, cluster) < threshold and < score
 *          	best cluster = cluster
 *          	best score = distance(instance, cluster)
 *           
 *       if best cluster is not none
 * 		 	add instance to best cluster
 *		 else
 *			create new cluster with instance as a member
 *          add cluster to clusters
 *          
 * This clusterer is useful when multiple passes over the data are undesirable or the number of clusters is unknown.
 * Tuning is required to choose an appropriate threshold that controls when new clusters can be created. 
 * 
 * Note that the order that clustering is sensitive to the order data is processed. 
 * 
 * To speed up the clustering even faster, the firstCandidate option can be set to true which will halt the 
 * search for the best cluster after the first candidate is found.
