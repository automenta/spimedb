/**
 * A fourth-order spline that allows fitting of points and velocities, and
 * matching of acceleration, at join points.
 * 
 * The general formula for the spline is a basic parameterized fourth-order
 * polynomial, by segment (s):
 *     x_s_n(t) = a_s_n t^4 + b_s_n t^3 + c_s_n t^2 + d_s_n t + e_s_n
 *    x'_s_n(t) = 4 a_s_n t^3 + 3 b_s_n t^2 + 2 c_s_n t + d_s_n
 *    x"_s_n(t) = 12 a_s_n t^2 + 6 b_s_n t + 2 c_s_n
 * 
 * We are trying to match:
 *      x_s_n(0) = p0_s_n       X_s(0) is the first point of segment s
 *     x'_s_n(0) = v0_s_n      X'_s(0) is the velocity at the first point of the segment s
 *      x_s_n(1) = p1_s_n       X_s(1) is the last point of the segment s
 *     x'_s_n(1) = v1_s_n      X'_s(1) is the velocity at the last point of the segment s
 *        p1_s_n = p0_s+1_n    The last point of segment s matches the first point of segment s+1
 *        v1_s_n = v0_s+1_n    The velocity at the last point of segment s matches the velocity at the first point of segment s+1
 *     x"_s_n(1) = x"_s+1_n(0) The acceleration at the last point of segment s matches the acceleration at the first point of segment s+1
 * 
 * This give us our 5 unknowns
 * 
 *     e_s_n = p0_s_n
 *     d_s_n = v0_s_n
