# SpimeDB - realtime spatiotemporal database

![SpimeDB Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/automenta/spimedb/master/data/spimedb_logo.png)

SpimeDB unifies the semantic, spatial, and temporal dimensions of data in a common n-dimensional ranged vector space.

Exploiting hyperdimensional locality enables efficient iterative access in display, analysis, and distributed computation applications.

## NObject (json) specification v-0.00
```js

	// ID, but if it's missing it can be assigned randomly (ex: UUID).
	I: <URL/UUID>,

	// Default name, label, title.  If missing, the ID is used
	N: "name",

	// Tags (array of strings, to the id's of tags from which this intensionally inherits)
	'<': [ tag1, tag2, ... ],

	// Description: string or a internationalized string table, ex:
	'_': { _: "xx" /* optional 2 letter country code indicating the default language involved in this nobject, which may be blank to represent complete internationalization */,
		  en: "english label",
		  es: "etiqueta en espaÃ±ol",
		  ...
	},

	// Author, origin, provenance: one or more nobject IDs. URL or email string works fine
	A: 'http://url/id',

	//Editing times.
	//  A number, or an array of numbers in milliseconds.
	//  First # is creation time, subsequent # indicate the delta offset to
	//    the last edit time (to save digits).
	//  Millisecond (ms) or lesser precision: hexadecimal long integer
	//  Finer than millisecond (ex: nanosecond): floating point number
	E: [ 238472389472, 23423432 ],

	//Expiration time in unixtime milliseconds.  After this time point, the nobject permits its deletion.  If zero, the object is considered temporary and can be deleted at any point.
	X: 23842738423,

	//Privacy / visiblity directives and public keys
	P: [ 'private', 'anonymous', ... ],

    // Spacetime bounds 4 (four) dimensional vector of spatial (0, 1, 2) and temporal (3) ranged values.
	'@': [
	    1.3,                            //point, matches within a finite epsilon range determined by floating poitn precision
	    [ -558.0, 2494.0 ],             //bounded range
	    [ -Infinity, +Infinifty ],      //matches any
	    NaN                             //matches any (shorter)
	]

```

## Spacetime vector space semantics

projection models (choose a default or assign these id's for encoding type):

### lat/lon/alt/unixtime
 * requires modulo +/-180 degrees longitude which may require preprocessing certain queries
 * distortion at poles

### x/y/z/unixtime - WSG geographic projection to (flat) euclidean 3D absolute space
 * TODO which is the newest projection model

### other models
 * ?

assuming flat temporal dynamics model: unixtime, or millisecond epochs since ~1970 will exhibit variations in precision if stored
as a 32-bit float, but 64-bit float ('double')' is better but not as ideal as 64-bit integer
('long').


## Additional payload data can be set at arbitary keys in the NObject:
```json

	// arbitrary named data values as fields with associated value
	key1: value,
	property2: data
```

##Graph (draft, essentially macros for node-centric graph declarative extensions)
```js
	//contents, contained, children, hyperedge internal adjacencies
	C: { /* one or more nobjects */ }

	//containers, parents, hyperedge external adjacencies
	P: { /* one or more nobjects */ }

	//incoming source directed edge ("link")
	//   the strength value can be used to indicate
	//    < 1.0 (default) strength / weight / priority / importance
	S: {
		//predicate  identifies an nobject
		predicate1: {
			[ //single or array object

				"identified_source_nobject",

				[ 0.85f, "another_identified_source_with_given_strength" ]

				{ /* inline object, with an effective ID prefixed by the outer object */ },

			]
		},
		predicate2: {
			[ "targetID", "targetID" ]
		}
	},

	//destination / outgoing target directed edge ("link")
	D: { /*..*/ },

	//undirected graph edge
	U: { /*..*/ },
```


## $N: NQuery NObject functions (draft)
```js
$N({ }) - wraps an instance of class N wrapping the given nobject data. throws exceptions if the data is invalid

$N(string) - resolves by id, unless the string begins with '{' in which case it is parsed as JSON

$N() - returns new NObject.HashNObject with random ID

$N([obj1, obj2, ..]) - returns a new container object with the supplied items as the children

n.uuid() //UUID, formed from the id plus some combination of time and authorship

n.json() //JSON representation of the nobject

n.equal(m) //equality test

n.merge(m[, merge parameters]) //returns an object containing the merge or union of two nobjects. any conflicts result in a conflict field with an array of describing each conflict such that no data is destroyed. if nothing can be merged, the result is equivalent to $N([n, m])

n.xml() //XML representation, which can be directly inserted into an HTML page DOM as a web widget

n.graph(target[, enabled graphed features and parameters]) //adds to the specified graph object nodes and edges representing 'n' and its connections. if target is falsy, it creates a new graph

n.clone(newID) //clone with new ID. if falsy: randomly generated ID and adds blank (anonymous) author '_' to the end of the author list, which will possibly be replaced with the actual author at some point prior to storage or transmission otherwise it will remain anonymous

n.modified() //sets the modification time to current system time in a new cloned object. optional parameter to specify this (backdate or forward date)

n.narsese() //narsese representation (string)

n.rdf(options) //RDF representation, options indicating which serialization (default: JSON RDF)

n.edges(incoming,outgoing,undirected, edgeVisitor) //iterate certain kinds of edges:
    //  edgeVisitor(rootNobject,incoming,outgoing,undirected,
    //					otherNobject,predicate[,strength])
    //		if returns falsy, iteration is cancelled

n.attr() //returns a new object containing only the non-nobject attributes
n.attr(x) //returns the data value associated with attribute key (if string), or sets the values if parameter is a JS object
n.attr(key, value) //sets the data value

n.distanceSpace(m) //returns space distance in meters. NaN if either has no spatial information, positive value if there is separation, 0 if fully coincident, and negative if partially overlapping as a percentage scaled in proportion (or inverse?) to the mean radii

n.distanceTime(m) //similar to space distance but for 1D time regions in seconds.

//tags are those edges which are stored in an array in .D.a (or just .D if the value is an array and not an object)
    //	this means the outgoing 'a' edges
    //  ('a' is the indefinite article predicate, as in owl:isA,  "is a", or "isA")

n.tagSet() - returns an array containing the tag strings

n.tagStrengths() - returns an object containing a mapping of the tags to the strength values, ex: { tag1: 1, tag2: 0.5 }

n.tag(tagID) - returns the strength (default 1.0) of the tag if present, or undefined otherwise, 0.0 or falsy being equivalent to undefined/null

n.tag(tagID[, strength]) - sets the tag strength of a particular tag
